00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.990
This

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.930
is a Toys R Us store in Redwood

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.950
City, California,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.772
but from what you see hanging on the rack serious

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.730
think about to be called Software

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.470
R Us. Most

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.600
of the titles being

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.480
sold here are for the Commodore

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.160
64, one of the

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.580
original home computers.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.610
But there's a lot

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.520
of life left in

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.710
that old machine new

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.990
software titles. Still, coming out for?

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.520
What is still a very large

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.710
installed user base.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.510
Today we take

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.069
a look at an oldie but goodie Commodore 64 on

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.400
this edition of the Computer Chronicles.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.530
Chronicles is made possible

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.770
in part by McGraw

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.998
Hill Publishers, a Byte Magazine and fix the bite information

00:00:59.068 --> 00:01:02.950
exchange in print and online bite and big serve computer

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:03.920
professionals

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.950
worldwide with

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.390
detailed information

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.560
on new hardware,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.420
software, and technologies.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.490
No.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.840
Welcome to the computer chronicles stewardship.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.030
Hey

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.040
this is Gary killed on your him playing.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.460
This new game from Spectrum

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.050
Holobyte called Tetris interesting thing about it.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.790
It's the first

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.670
game software, so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.720
many states would my Russian programmers.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.439
But what's really interesting is here's a hot new piece

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:33.010
of software out machine does it come out for first.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.330
The good old Commodore 64.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.530
This is the model day of personal computers.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.190
Yet people are still buying them.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.946
People are writing new software for hot come through his

00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:43.604
you know gesture mill had a Commodore before he moved

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:46.410
over to the Tarring and Jack's philosophy is to minimize

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.051
the end-user price and just flood the market with the

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:49.500
product.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.360
He did it with a $10 calculator them.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.827
These are that one. He did also with the Commodore

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:56.195
64 less than $200. The competition is 5 times that

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:56.540
price.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.931
It's a big good basic computer for a very formal

00:01:58.981 --> 00:01:59.330
Christ.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.510
The result is there is,

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.320
but 17 million. He's 9 states alone,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.520
he rides a real good hardware bed for software

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.821
writers, 'cause they can take the software development constant amortize

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:09.330
across these millions of units.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.640
The result is you get a lot

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.370
of good software to very affordable.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.730
Price Gary today. We're going to focus on the good

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.760
old Commodore 64 will meet lots of C64.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.810
users and see the interesting applications.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.450
They've developed for the computer

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.570
now. One of the reasons

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.657
the Commodore 64 is still around is it got a

00:02:23.704 --> 00:02:24.700
new operating system.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.770
A couple of years ago,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.478
something called GeOS. We begin today by visiting the man

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:31.000
who wrote GeOS: Brian Docherty at Berkeley Softworks.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.367
The history of personal computers is marked by some spectacular

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:38.950
successes and failures.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.840
But the award for popularity

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.820
must go to the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.141
Commodore 64, a little 8-bit machine that refuses to die.

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:45.540
64 is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.780
commercial success

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.020
and its enormous userbase have inspired some software developers

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.130
to take a second

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.240
look at the 64th

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.740
potential one of those

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.969
companies is Berkeley Softworks next to the University campus in

00:02:59.035 --> 00:02:59.630
Berkeley,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.176
California. where we did is we looked at these markets

00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:06.460
at the common 64 monitor the first than the Apple

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:09.940
2 and basically it takes awhile for people to really

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.150
push the machine to its total limits.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.390
Ann one of the things that we really believe in here

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.440
that the rest of the software

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.063
world I think is only really started to catch

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:21.580
on to is

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.101
very sophisticated development tools in the net of all that

00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:25.340
is,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.920
we're capable. Now it all.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.867
The applications for these machines that I don't think people

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:34.620
really thought these machines were capable of performing.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.534
Most important product is the GeOS operating system a graphic

00:03:39.614 --> 00:03:41.950
interface for the 64 and 128

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.460
that features pull-down

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.810
menus. Icons and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.303
windows. Operating system opens the door to some very sophisticated

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:54.320
applications like a spreadsheet called Geo Calc.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.440
And Geo file

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.380
a database

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.120
with user-designed forms.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.980
There's even a desktop publishing package, something

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.320
usually requiring

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.750
big memories and big budgets.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.620
But at Berkeley Softworks, it's

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.940
all in the code memory

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.370
is probably coding much more efficiently.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.330
The theorem of Computer Sciences.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.330
Any computer program can be implemented by one bit.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.700
Turing machine that's actually a theory.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.010
That's been proven in computer science,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.148
so even though this 8-bit processor is capable of doing all

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:28.519
the things that are much more expensive computer like say

00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:30.320
a Macintosh or not being p****

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.788
is capable of doing now may not be able to

00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:33.670
do it as fast.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.190
Although we try to make up for the limitations incapability.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.790
The machine by programming more efficiently.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.730
But you can actually do anything with the computer.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.470
Joining us in the studio now is

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.350
Lucy Morton looses a member of the Diablo Valley Common.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.988
64 users group and next to Lucy is Mike Dunn's

00:05:03.046 --> 00:05:06.200
more a member of the Commodore owners of the Peninsula.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.520
Carey make the Commodore of uses groups,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.320
they principally see 64 users are puts a composition.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.574
There are some music groups that are just Commodore 64

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.389
and there might be some that are have Amiga

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:18.890
and 64.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.190
You can keep through

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.880
bulletin boards over Modems is that correct.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.270
23 both border rbis is a large herd

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.990
those bulletin boards run by

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.400
64 centimeters

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.150
or 9, I

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.640
Generally on another machine. They might have 6464 um.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.980
Database downloads, Lucy Um maybe a little presumptuous

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.379
of mne, but you don't appear to be the average game

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.330
player of the you're using Hunter 64 by 64.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.428
Interested in computers and my husband also does some programming.

00:05:55.491 --> 00:05:58.770
And the program is very easy on this machine because

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:01.670
you can very easily and we make mistakes very

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.720
often. Primarily programming in BASIC.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.082
Thank you have a program that you wrote that that

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.480
helps you make sweaters that

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.954
correct that well. Help me to chart them for making

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:11.100
as

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.680
something else.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.412
Yes, this is an interactive program and as you run

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:17.560
through the program,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.007
it asks you what style you would like you have

00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:22.617
to have one thing before you start which is the

00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:25.390
number of stitches per inch and the number of rows

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.360
per inch. But you

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.460
get from a swatch like this all right.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.392
We've already decided we're going to make a jacket and

00:06:31.446 --> 00:06:33.672
that we're going to have a knit-on

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:36.170
band that is that right in one of the sweater

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.570
and so we're going to have it in ribbing and

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:40.753
now we have to decide to put one of the

00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:41.080
neck.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.810
I think will select a V-neck today and we're

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:45.940
going to put the next day and writing,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.110
one with the front then.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.570
Through

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.550
this translation

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.448
through the whole thing than what kind of sleeve do

00:06:52.506 --> 00:06:55.056
you want at will escape no sleeve for this so

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.200
I'm not having a raglan sleeve task?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.460
You want longer short

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.530
and it will go on with this sort of

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.570
thing do you want

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.256
to fit its lever straight sleep and it goes on

00:07:04.314 --> 00:07:05.190
through the all

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.340
the questions then?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.950
It will program shows. Yes,

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.337
it will do this on the screen also but it

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.550
will end up with something like this,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.930
I guess.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.980
What you'd like to

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.140
do

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.010
you yes now this printed out yet.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.297
This prints out all the directions for actually for a sweater

00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:22.080
very similar to one that I have

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.280
an order were you designed this in your

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.160
own.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.590
That's great. I'm going to turn to Mike now.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.212
If you could slide the computer over to Mike and

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.070
Mike you've been using the C64

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:33.580
to do some kind of artwork.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.710
Tell me what you do.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.330
I have made a few uh pictures

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.030
screens? Particular purpose

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.890
will just to make a picture or sometimes I would.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.500
It would be a title screen for a program.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.880
I was working on

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.210
for

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.970
a menu. You use the 6064 plus one

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.910
else koala pad?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:54.000
Kind of software

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.050
there is a koala pad uh painter

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.733
so can you show some of the things you do

00:07:58.798 --> 00:07:59.060
with

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.346
qualifies share? Let me load this good cola painter in

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.330
okay have the menu here.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.597
You would do is you could catalogue the disc from

00:08:08.663 --> 00:08:09.330
that icon.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.489
You could save get or name and save so we

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:14.570
can just click on the get.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.750
Suppose we want to

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.990
look at the wacko's

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.494
and so we click on getting up the Laco pressing

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:21.240
a button.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.850
We have a loaded okay.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.900
This is a picture

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.450
okay. That's pretty good, and that is what?

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:28.210
What did you

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.202
create this work. This is for a bulletin board that

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.490
I knew the guy that was running it and

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.830
he wanted to the world

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.580
there a wacko.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.730
Can you pull up something else in the

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.010
middle of working on sure just?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:46.545
Go to swap here at that is 4 program menu

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.760
program.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.926
We see is the screen here and I could press

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:51.220
um.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.680
Abcd suppose you want to add some

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.850
artwork to the screen, and how you do that.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.443
Okay, there's a park on the bond still working on

00:09:00.517 --> 00:09:01.910
going to zoom here,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.540
but the window down here.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.440
And touch up these letters selected color.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.710
Are so want to get rid of the green line?

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:16.326
That is doing pixel by pixel organ drag the pointer

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:17.050
across.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.635
And then you could just paint a graphic in that

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.020
little

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.470
space in the right. If you

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:22.710
want to do or you know

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.850
this is a really it takes its time consuming.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.453
Interesting things is that this is a video composite video

00:09:28.497 --> 00:09:30.965
Samuel in camcorders and so forth so you could actually

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.850
make titles and all sorts of things here.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.280
Home videos thing I guess Mike.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.615
I mean, you have your sort of graphic design station

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.623
here for an investment of probably well under 400-dollars compared

00:09:39.668 --> 00:09:41.150
to some of the expensive systems.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.050
We're seemed well or that.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.419
Lucy and Mike thank you very much as we've seen

00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:48.190
users groups have been a very important element of the

00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:49.450
success of the Commodore

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.540
64. We asked when the

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.035
Woods to go visit a users group meeting in Foster

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:53.340
City,

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.090
California and

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.210
here's a report.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.420
If you buy for price you don't always get good

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.380
service. And

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.560
that's especially

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.000
true for Commodore 64

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.630
and 128 owners whose low-cost machines.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.610
Get no support

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.450
from the mass merchandisers

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.810
who sell them through the Commodore

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.930
users group like

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.570
this one in Foster City,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.750
California, where

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.700
people like Ralph Horn Brook tryout programs

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.690
trade tips and

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.390
just playing get the help

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.490
that they need. There

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.060
are almost impossible

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.930
to describe

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:25.860
the me being

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.930
in an absolute

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:28.220
neophyte 3 or 4

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.160
years ago we

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.780
knew nothing.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.560
You go or what do you do?

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.660
How do you work

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.480
these things we knew we want to get into

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.650
it but we didn't

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:38.470
know how to

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:39.640
get into it, but

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.600
we do is we offer.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:41.990
Formal

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.931
hand-holding type meeting where if somebody doesn't understand how to

00:10:45.988 --> 00:10:48.330
use the computer, we'll sit down with them.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.840
Show them how to operated show them how to?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.050
Do the various

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.100
uh processes

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.864
that are required to run programs and show them how

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:00.480
to put everything together.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.220
Just how to use their computer and use it to

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:04.590
productive advantage.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.940
Despite the fact that

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.100
the more powerful.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.523
Amiga is now seen at the Commodore users group meetings

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:11.270
in the sea.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.870
64 is still going strong.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.940
Price keeps dropping and people keep buying them,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.650
which is why it should come

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:18.570
as no surprise

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.417
that membership in groups like this is actually increased over

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:24.030
the years in Foster City,

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.490
California for the computer chronicles.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.470
I'm Wendy Woods.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.257
With us in the studio now is Malcolm low with

00:11:44.317 --> 00:11:47.505
the Commodore West users group and next to Malcolm is

00:11:47.565 --> 00:11:49.550
Kelly flock with Electronic Arts.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.300
Earth is uh obviously a well known software producer in

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.650
game software producer how important is the Commodore 64 relative.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.040
Dear old marketing plan like the Apple relative

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.930
apollonian pieces

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.770
of work to common is very important.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.060
I would say that it's our

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.140
second most important format behind the IBM compatible format

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.317
does it both come to the mix of good target

00:12:07.368 --> 00:12:07.520
for

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.990
game?

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.540
Probably

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:10.280
the leading

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.072
home computer with the installed base bikes 7000000 units and

00:12:14.134 --> 00:12:16.620
it's very game intensive since you know,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.814
we make a lot of it enter tainment software natural

00:12:19.876 --> 00:12:20.440
place for

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.247
us to be. There's going to program in attract mode

00:12:23.303 --> 00:12:26.390
here in the background running called the wine steward.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:27.180
Can you tell us

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.810
a little bit about that program?

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.344
Yeah, sure that the ones should is a program that's

00:12:31.393 --> 00:12:34.573
designed to help people who are unfamiliar with purchasing wines

00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:36.610
to be able to make a choice based on the

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.480
food that they are going to have for dinner.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.482
This is written for the 64 and it's used in

00:12:42.552 --> 00:12:43.390
supermarkets

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.150
understand

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.590
that's correct. Yes,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.720
I do. It shows how you use it?

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.710
Yeah, sure the basic screen?

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.989
Is um a menu of a choice is moving down

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.250
menu with the?

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.152
White button that's on the cabinet and using the green

00:12:58.224 --> 00:12:58.730
button.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.474
You select a further menu move down to the choice

00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:03.850
and select again.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.960
A choice of uh total of 9 wines.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.860
It was making

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.980
its decision as to what wants to

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.419
recommend an that's correct. There are 3 on the first

00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:14.820
green which are budget priced wines.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.879
The second screen offers you another 3 popular price and

00:13:17.934 --> 00:13:19.190
the third premium price

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.660
wise.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.250
People like this is actually is they seem

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.240
to take it very

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.020
long day any particular reason why you wrote

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.491
it for 64. Pretty well and easy computer program for

00:13:30.558 --> 00:13:31.960
has lots of features,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.660
particularly color and you can program different pants white.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.101
Killy let's turn to you and Uh Electronic Arts has

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.200
a new game for the 64 called skate or die.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.520
And I went to tell me about that.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.690
As

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.040
a multi vent game where

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.280
you it's kind of like

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.690
a skateboard simulation.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.254
We get to do all the things that you wouldn't

00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:52.020
normally do unless you want to

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.110
risk your knees and your elbow ride.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.950
Olofin another

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.910
scars as we say.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.390
Okay, Kelly. Show me how you place catered.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:58.790
I this

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.640
is the half pipe, which isn't on

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.860
regular skateboarding event. You do it to a combination.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.950
That's a kick turn of joystick moves and button controls.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.010
No need to look at the documentation

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:13.990
do that on purpose, um,

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.570
I wish.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.270
I'm trying get up in the air on this one.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.010
All right.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.660
Oh,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.350
almost.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.870
So it's a combination of joystick and the buttons.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.990
Practical

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.560
nice

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.760
move.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.950
However.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.462
So there are 12 different moves you can do in

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:39.930
here.

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.861
And you get points for the variety of your routine

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.030
and you get bonus points at the end.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.220
So I got 8000 points is pretty good score.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.010
You can get up to 15,000 points in

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.540
here.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.059
Yeah, Kelly is catered I available on any machine other

00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:54.250
than the Commodore 64 all

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.348
right now, so I will only on the Commodore was

00:14:56.393 --> 00:14:58.810
designed in the common takes advantage of some unique

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.640
features such as the Sprites and 6.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.738
Colors in the 3 boys is where in the process

00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:05.170
of developing further machine killers are the more

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.650
things you can do. Besides just getting on this ramp

00:15:07.697 --> 00:15:09.080
or there's a lot of 5 events.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:09.270
The

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.590
ramp is the only meta model

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.560
unreal skateboarding. But there's a couple of downhill events,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.106
where you can break bottles and skate through Bush is

00:15:16.154 --> 00:15:16.490
a drain

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.720
pipe and there's a pulled

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.890
Yost event, where you have 3 computer points,

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.580
you get that one with little marine

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:22.720
bottoms.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.470
Pretty fun

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.030
when we get what about

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.530
the price this tested

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.480
retail on his

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.441
2995. And is there something about the current market is

00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:32.980
don't get more important than I am very only 14

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:33.350
as the

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.230
Common Market gets older. It becomes

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.340
more price-sensitive.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.700
There's a lot more product

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.171
developed for it as opposed to say a market like

00:15:40.222 --> 00:15:40.840
being meager

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.510
there. Very few games right now,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.550
so that's going to be something you're de-emphasizing after

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.614
well no that um we make it up and volume

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:48.130
Google we

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.918
do it. Welcome thank you very much Gary earlier this

00:15:50.972 --> 00:15:51.240
week.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.567
I got a chance to talk to the new president

00:15:53.621 --> 00:15:54.270
of Komondor.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.524
Max toy and I started out by asking in the

00:15:56.577 --> 00:15:59.260
Commodore looks at the 64 is really a game machine

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.670
would be really easy to say that what we seen

00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:04.615
in the marketplace that is continuing to being used in

00:16:04.668 --> 00:16:05.150
business.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.590
We're seeing it used on broader applications.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.450
We've ever seen before. Commodore,

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:12.355
64, is being used for desktop publishing being used in

00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:13.700
the small tiny business.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.150
It's been having a resurgence back in the education marketplace.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.700
So it is more much more than a toy marketplace.

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.782
Now I will tell you that we have seen a

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:25.411
growth and enhancement in the entertainement marketplace to some of

00:16:25.464 --> 00:16:28.880
the software that we're still seeing new business software being

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.580
written for the product as well

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.231
as it is still a current machine are people still

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:33.610
buying

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.035
counters that scored incredible thing about the parental 64 seat

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:38.480
does continue to grow and.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.288
The market continues to expand we sell worldwide between a

00:16:42.353 --> 00:16:45.636
million and a million a half Commodore 64 is every

00:16:45.702 --> 00:16:46.030
year.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.863
What we're seeing is a whole new wave of customers

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.433
coming into the marketplace Commodore 64 is always been strong

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.700
in the small tiny business marketplace.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.609
We're seeing a lot of young first time users coming

00:16:57.666 --> 00:16:58.750
in the marketplace.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.110
In fact, I've heard it,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.844
said that Commodore wherever comes more first time computers users

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.955
than any other company in the world brand new software

00:17:07.012 --> 00:17:10.180
is coming in the marketplace and you gotta remember it's

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.069
not old technology to the first time user and we're

00:17:13.126 --> 00:17:16.015
seeing a lot of people using this computer is their

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:19.470
first entry into the power of computing and therefore you're

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:22.758
bringing new customers in every year come into this market

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:25.252
place and so it is new technology as far as

00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:28.710
they're concerned and we see software people continue to use

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.471
the high performance capabilities for a very high-value dollar who

00:17:32.528 --> 00:17:32.870
do you

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.670
see that right now is the competition for the 64?

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.018
Is it? Is it the lower-cost apple or is it

00:17:38.074 --> 00:17:40.366
the entire IAS tea or you or you going up

00:17:40.422 --> 00:17:42.490
against a Nintendo and see good away.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.100
The answer

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.150
really is probably

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.303
see all of the above at one end of the

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.040
marketplace.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.970
You compete against the Nintendo's to game machines?

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.209
What we're seeing our parents are deciding that they would

00:17:53.265 --> 00:17:56.058
much rather have more than just a game machine for

00:17:56.113 --> 00:17:58.850
their children to use and use the entertainments,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.139
software and taken the step further with education and real

00:18:02.195 --> 00:18:04.480
use that the the child can use it for but

00:18:04.536 --> 00:18:07.490
the same time were still being seen used in business,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.930
or seen it used in television production environment as well.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.700
It's a very, very important part of our business.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.882
It's continuing your girl who are continuing to spend art

00:18:16.938 --> 00:18:20.510
research and development dollars on the product and the prickles

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:22.520
and support capable of the problem,

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.890
so it's in very, very important part.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.113
Existence today in its future if you look our greatest

00:18:29.172 --> 00:18:29.590
assets.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.590
There are installed base. There are manufacturing.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.890
Indesign capability to build a machine from Silicon up.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.647
And the fact that we've got such a strong active

00:18:38.704 --> 00:18:39.910
user group community,

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.792
I the passion that the Commodore users have for the

00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:45.958
Commodore machines and for what they've been able to do

00:18:46.014 --> 00:18:50.140
with those machines absolutely incredible and that's exciting that's fun.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.550
No no.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.320
Joining

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.440
us in the studio now is Bill Morrow,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.450
a Commodore 64 user from Pacifica,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.950
California. Behind Bill Gary's a table full of synthesizers.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.220
All hooked up to his 64 year very accomplished musician?

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.540
What is it about this?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.010
A Commodore 64 makes a good music computer

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.940
and then one day inexpensive?

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:20.260
The

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.870
other thing is the Sid Chip in that uh sound

00:19:23.952 --> 00:19:24.690
interface

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.660
device and it was a situate do.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.200
It makes sense. It has 3.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.050
Musicians in

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.240
its you could say

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.060
and these 3 musicians can play individual.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.050
Notes separate

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.160
or they can play

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.552
on simultaneously. We can have up Lou Anna Bays and

00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:44.680
a violin plan all at same time,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.720
giving you can experiment with

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.470
the different sounds and exciting so far.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:50.060
I didn't

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.950
study. These tax deal. A sustained release.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.400
You got some software

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.778
in here. Some composition software called Master composers and she

00:19:58.844 --> 00:20:00.370
was how that works use.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.850
This is s*** bill.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:03.220
Here

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.130
you can see

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.480
I already entered

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.610
after you know

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.040
you'll be here and

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.430
I have 3 boys is I've got my musician number

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.960
2 here.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.480
You see I have

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.160
some rest up there,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.333
so I have about I would say I have 16

00:20:21.418 --> 00:20:22.190
positions

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.660
that I can scoop.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.922
Want to go ahead and out and listen to that

00:20:26.974 --> 00:20:27.290
music.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.600
You just put in there and this is using only

00:20:29.653 --> 00:20:30.230
a situation

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.520
right. No uh synthesized

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.610
now, just to comment

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.770
on okay. I'll We

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.610
want to listen to uh.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.830
And it's showing the

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.180
notes that it's playing in

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.930
the goes on. That's

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.030
all just aiming at a slightly for as

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.390
they are playing at all

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.030
coming out of 54, no help.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.760
Another notes you had entered

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.960
before I hope this.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.670
Okay, can, we turn that off just a second.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.352
And I want to ask you now to give us

00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:59.501
the whole ball game here and hook up all your

00:20:59.548 --> 00:21:01.790
synthesizers and see if the 64 can handle all of

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.920
that? What do we do to do that?

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.610
First of

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.680
all I had the

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.440
media any phrase Hook to the Commodore hooked up

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.350
with the Commodore and for the midi fit interface.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.340
I go through a mimetite rhubarb boxes.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.860
We can see from that I hooked up

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.010
to 123 keyboards, which all

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.850
are multi channels and I have about.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.070
I have about 14

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.990
channels or tracks would

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.050
make of amassed track different tracks.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.040
Running then we have the drum machine.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.490
Ankama sounds unit rate was about 16 checks?

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:37.570
What software

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.020
is controlling off the software

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.750
is.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.780
Software and it's a very

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.240
powerful software

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.640
you can. Record with this dislike

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.730

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.470
play all you can insert the notes?

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.740
From

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.500
okay how bout take one let's see

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.420
what it sounds like acid take one's

Those

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.356
which are doing I'm doing an original tune that I

00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:10.320
am James

Now let me let

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.400
me ask you, you're a musician.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.332
What's the what's the pleasure of working with something like

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:27.620
this,

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.020
see 64. You told us before you were thinking about

00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:31.700
getting out of the music business.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:31.890
But

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.220
now you're back in pleasure

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.930
is that don't have to.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.835
Have a lot of musicians to rehearse where I don't

00:22:38.895 --> 00:22:40.140
have to tell me play.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.720
My musics

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:41.600
simple. I want

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.110
you know, and I've got a drummer that this

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.230
crazy machine will

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.777
just play all day long and I must have time

00:22:47.836 --> 00:22:49.080

this week, there are

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.377
reports that the new debased 4 program has some bugs

00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:25.620
in the SQL mode bite.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.020
Magazines micro bites service in a company called quad base.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.438
Both reported that responses to SQL query statements can lead

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:35.352
to incorrect reports on the number of records or to

00:23:35.408 --> 00:23:38.770
an internal error message that prevents the execution of the

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.105
query. Ashton Tate says it is investigating the reports the

00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:42.840
in Verviers,

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.020

has been discovered on a Mac.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.135
Cdrom disc a public-domain software virus infected 7 files in

00:23:51.192 --> 00:23:51.700
the disk,

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.880
including a hypercard stack and stuff,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.293
it the disk is called the Mega ROM and it's

00:23:56.349 --> 00:23:59.603
produced by quantum leap of knowledge and the company says

00:23:59.659 --> 00:24:02.240
it has found out a laminated the virus and new

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.709
copies of the death for clean viruses path through a

00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:07.510
hard disk quality alcohol.

Cause with an unrecoverable systems crash,

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.414
the virus reportedly can be detected by the virus detected

00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:17.910
program by Apple's program called virus are ex.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.752
The Russians say they had been hit by their first

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:21.680
computer virus.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.910
The virus known as dos 62 infected 80.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.360
Computers at the USSR Academy of Sciences.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.050
Russian suspect the virus got into the system.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.773
After some students who attended an international summer computer camp

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.630
attempted to copy some infected programs using the academy's computers.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:42.321
IBM says it has developed a new experimental circuit that

00:24:42.385 --> 00:24:45.040
could lead to peace with mainframe speed.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.480
The cmos circuit is one of 330 fifth.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:50.864
NIS of a human hair switch on and off 30,000,000,000

00:24:50.929 --> 00:24:51.320
times.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.982
A second memory chip using the new circuit could contain

00:24:55.047 --> 00:24:57.270
up to 256 megabits of information.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.650
Time for this week software review here's Paul Schindler.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.764
And are available minute. We can't settle the age old

00:25:03.823 --> 00:25:07.290
question of whether you really need an encyclopedia or not.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.560
But if you decide you do for yourself,

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.723

60 megabytes of data you can pay a dollar.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.672
A minute to access this encyclopedia online via Dow Jones

00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:30.072
or you pay $300 once and have this in your

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:30.630
home now.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.460
We're going to show any screens.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.743
Today could screens full of text aren't very interesting to

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:38.025
look at but I can tell you that when you

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.920
give the electronic encyclopedia search program that word finds every

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.850
article in the encyclopedia that includes that word,

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.220
and tells you the headline of the article.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.461
You can read it printed or put in a disk

00:25:49.517 --> 00:25:51.590
loud be careful what you do with that

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.870
disk because you don't

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.750
want to plagiarize this work now.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.932
